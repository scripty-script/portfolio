            Hello! I am a developer with expertise in Vue.js and Laravel.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-400">
            I began my career as a Junior Web Developer at NetlinkVoice, where I
            was responsible for rebranding the user interface of our main
            system. In just one month, I was able to successfully launch the
            updated system with minimal issues. Over the next few months, I
            worked on multiple projects simultaneously and was quickly promoted
            to Senior Developer within 10 months. During this time, I refined my
            programming, problem-solving, and time-management skills.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-400">
            Due to my dedication and hard work, I was then promoted to Team Lead
            Developer, where I am responsible for leading the FAXedge project.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-400">
            I am eager to offer my services with you. Please feel free to
            contact me at your convenience.
