            Hello! I am a developer with expertise in Vue.js and Laravel.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-400">
            I started my career as a Junior Web Developer at NetlinkVoice, where
            I took on the task of rebranding the user interface of our main
            system. Within a month, the updated system was successfully launched
            with minimal issues. Over the following months, I was involved in
            several projects, which helped me grow significantly as a developer.
            After 10 months, I took on a more senior role, further refining my
            programming, problem-solving, and time-management skills.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-400">
            I am eager to offer my services with you. Please feel free to
            contact me at your convenience.
